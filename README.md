# Charting Pathways: Predicting Preliminary Year Pass Rates at UMass Dartmouth

## Project Overview
This project aims to identify key factors predicting student success in transitioning from the preliminary year to their chosen degree programs at UMass Dartmouth. Using logistic regression, we analyze a comprehensive dataset to uncover significant predictors and offer insights into improving student success rates.

## Key Questions
- How do we handle missing data in crucial variables for predicting student success?
- What is the optimal set of factors important for predicting a studentâ€™s success in passing the preliminary year?
- Can our analysis offer meaningful insights into the factors influencing student success in the preliminary year?

## Findings
 - Variables such as the number of workshops attended and completion of campus event requirements emerged as significant predictors of student success.
 - Both academic readiness and engagement with support services play crucial roles in influencing student outcomes.
 - Missing data, when removed, did not significantly impact the overall analysis results.

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights the importance of academic preparation and support services in predicting student success during the preliminary year. These insights can guide targeted interventions to support at-risk students, helping UMass Dartmouth improve student retention and success rates.
